# ⚡ HyperScanner (hxscanner) v1.4

**HyperScanner** is a powerful and futuristic HTTP status code scanner that takes a list of IPs and classifies their responses into structured folders and files. Designed with speed, clarity, and beauty, HyperScanner simplifies the process of analyzing HTTP responses.

---

## ✨ Features

- 🔍 **Scan IP & URLs Lists**: Quickly scans any list of IPs and fetches their HTTP status codes.
- 🗂️ **Organized Output**: Automatically creates folder structures based on HTTP status codes (e.g., `1xx`, `2xx`, `3xx`, `4xx`, `5xx`).
- 📁 **File-Based Response Storage**: Saves each IP's response into corresponding status code files, such as `200.txt` for HTTP 200 responses.
- ✅ **Detailed Logs**: Tracks results in clean and structured log files:
  - `ip_exist.txt`: List of valid IPs.
  - `ip_invalid.txt`: List of invalid IPs.
  - `log.txt`: Comprehensive log of the scan.
- 🎨 **Enhanced CLI**: Provides color-coded terminal outputs for improved readability (coming soon: icons and categories).
- 💻 **Cross-Platform**: Compatible with Windows, Linux, and Mac.
